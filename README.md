# fastball

This repository contains C++ implementations of the curveball and fastball algorithms for randomly sampling incidence matrices with fixed row and column sums. The R code illustrates how to use these functions in R, and provides some comparisons of their running times.

For a description of these algorithms, see Godard, K., & Neal, Z. P. (2021). fastball: A fast algorithm to sample binary matrices with fixed marginals. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2112.04017](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04017).
